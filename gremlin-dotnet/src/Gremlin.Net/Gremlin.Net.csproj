    <Description>
      Gremlin.Net for Apache TinkerPop™ is a language variant and driver for .NET.
    </Description>
    <Summary>
      Apache TinkerPop™ is a graph computing framework for both graph databases (OLTP) and graph analytic systems (OLAP).
      Gremlin is the graph traversal language of TinkerPop. It can be described as a functional, data-flow language
      that enables users to succinctly express complex traversals on (or queries of) their application’s property graph.

      Gremlin.Net implements Gremlin within .NET. C# syntax has the same constructs as Java including “dot notation”
      for function chaining (a.b.c), round bracket function arguments (a(b,c))`, and support for global namespaces
      (a(b()) vs a(__.b()))`. As such, anyone familiar with Gremlin-Java will immediately be able to work with
      Gremlin.Net. Moreover, there are a few added constructs to Gremlin.Net that make traversals a bit more succinct.

      Please see the reference documentation at Apache TinkerPop for more information on usage.

      NOTE: Gremlin.Net is an extension of the Gremlin.Net driver by Florian Hockmann (versions &lt;= 0.X) and is now
      included as part of the Apache TinkerPop project. The 'old' Gremlin.Net driver is however still supported.
